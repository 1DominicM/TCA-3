These chemicals, designed to kill pests, often have unintended consequences on non-target organisms like bees. Pesticides can harm bees directly by poisoning them or indirectly by contaminating their food sources and habitat. Exposure to pesticides weakens bees' immune systems, making them more susceptible to diseases and parasites. Additionally, pesticides can disrupt bees' navigation abilities, impairing their foraging and communication behaviors. To help bee populations and ecosystem health, it is crucial to reduce the use of harmful pesticides and adopt sustainable agricultural practices that aren't harmful.";
